For nonrobust estimation: Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm [1].
For robust estimation: iterative reweighted least squares algorithm ([2], [3]). At each iteration, the robust weights are recalculated based on each observation’s residual from the previous iteration. These weights downweight outliers, so that their influence on the fit is decreased. Iterations continue until the weights converge.
When observation/measurement weights that depends on the fitted model: iterative generalized least squares algorithm
